/* Now weÂ´ll use the "FIXTURE" feature of google test.
   In a nutshell:
    - If you have many simmilar tests, you do not want to duplicate the code
      for the commmon set-up phase. (Innitialization of data, e.g, objects of a class).

    - This allows to have objects and functions used by all the tests in a test Case.  

    - The idea is to avoid duplication of the code necessary to create and destruct the
      objects shared between tests.  One can also define sub-routines called by tests .

    - IMPORTANT: The tests share code, not data, i.e. Each test gets a copy of the fixture.
      So, data modified by one tests does not affect data of other tests.  
      This is because -tests must be independent and repeatable-.
    - SUMMARY: A test Fixture is a class cointainning the common setup-code for a group of tests.
